# Changelog

This file records notable user-facing and operational changes to Crestmap.

The project did not previously maintain Git tags or a changelog. Entries through
0.1.192 were reconstructed from commit dates, commit messages, and version values
in the Makefile and deployment manifests. Dates below are supporting commit dates,
not independently recorded production deployment times. Merge-only commits are
omitted in favor of their underlying change commits. Range headings group related
development eras and do not imply that every intermediate version number shipped.

## Unreleased

### 0.1.275 - 2026-09-14

- Prioritize measured and off-road terrain readings, add zoom-aware temperature
  spacing, and suppress repeated rounded values across a wider radius so nearby
  duplicate readings no longer overwhelm incidents or map geography.

### 0.1.274 - 2026-09-14

- Move temperature chips just beside their road coordinates with a compact
  matching anchor dot, and split the broad green range so 75–84°F reads amber
  before progressing through orange and red heat bands.

### 0.1.273 - 2026-09-14

- Remove temperature connector arrows and shrink readings into compact color
  chips centered on their exact coordinates; overlapping lower-priority readings
  are omitted instead of being detached from the road.

### 0.1.272 - 2026-09-14

- Replace detached temperature numbers with coordinate-anchored, color-banded
  badges; distinguish modeled terrain highs and lows with compact symbols and
  reserve red tones for temperatures of 95°F and above.

### 0.1.271 - 2026-09-14

- Focus temperature labels on road corridors and retain only a small set of
  elevation-derived topographic highs and lows; clear incident-marker selection
  whenever its detail sheet closes.

### 0.1.270 - 2026-09-14

- Handle Mac trackpad pinch gestures separately from ordinary wheel input so
  Leaflet's wheel-delta sigmoid cannot flatten small pinch movements.

### 0.1.269 - 2026-09-14

- Make MacBook trackpad map zoom substantially more responsive and restore useful
  mile-marker density sooner, including half- and quarter-mile sampling at close
  zoom levels where surveyed source points support it.

### 0.1.268 - 2026-09-14

- Increase desktop trackpad map-zoom responsiveness and replace the fractional
  mile-marker zoom discontinuity with progressively denser 10-, 5-, 2-, and
  1-mile sampling as users zoom closer.

### 0.1.267 - 2026-09-11

- Hide the mobile incident-list drag handle and close button in the desktop
  sidebar, preventing their unstyled native button controls from appearing above
  search.

### 0.1.266 - 2026-09-11

- Hide the obsolete floating incident-list scroll arrows on desktop as well as
  mobile, leaving the standard scrollable list without a stray pill control.

### 0.1.265 - 2026-09-11

- Keep the bottom incident toggle beneath list and detail sheets so it cannot
  briefly appear as a stray button above a pane during transitions or dragging.

### 0.1.264 - 2026-09-11

- Hand a downward incident or camera content scroll directly to the containing
  sheet when the record reaches the top, allowing one continuous gesture to
  scroll and then lower or dismiss the pane.

### 0.1.263 - 2026-09-11

- Rename incident “Copy link” actions to “Share,” opening the native iOS/browser
  share sheet when supported and retaining clipboard copy as the fallback.

### 0.1.262 - 2026-09-11

- Show a compact loading spinner and destination name while switching between
  Forest and Malibu, without restoring the full-map tile reload cover.

### 0.1.261 - 2026-09-11

- Give mobile pane drags exclusive gesture control by suspending map pan and
  pinch handling until incident-list, incident-detail, and camera-detail drags
  finish or cancel.

### 0.1.260 - 2026-09-11

- Let mobile close buttons bypass sheet dragging and avoid persistent touch-hover
  behavior so incident-list, incident-detail, and camera-detail panes close on the
  first tap.

### 0.1.259 - 2026-09-11

- Keep cached map tiles visible during page and tile reloads instead of covering
  the map with a full-frame grey loading shimmer.

### 0.1.258 - 2026-09-11

- Enlarge the close icon and preserve its existing 44-pixel control footprint
  across mobile incident lists, incident details, and camera details.

### 0.1.257 - 2026-09-11

- Reduce mobile map tile memory and defer tile replacement until gestures finish,
  preventing iPhone Safari from flashing blank frames while panning and zooming.

### 0.1.256 - 2026-09-11

- Allow map pinch zooming to begin on incident and camera markers instead of
  swallowing the first touch as a marker-only interaction.
- Reserve enough vertical space for mobile sheet controls so the “← Incidents”
  button cannot overlap or clip the incident and camera content below it.

### 0.1.255 - 2026-09-11

- Preserve finger-tracked positions through every incident-list and detail-sheet
  state transition, preventing release-time jumps when opening, resizing, or closing.

### 0.1.254 - 2026-09-11

- Preserve the finger-tracked detail-sheet height through its closing animation
  so a downward swipe cannot flash or jump upward before dismissal.

### 0.1.253 - 2026-09-11

- Apply the mobile header boundary to incident details and camera details as well
  as the incident list, including their full-height drag positions.

### 0.1.252 - 2026-09-11

- Stop the expanded incident list immediately below the mobile header and remove
  upward drag overshoot that could obscure the header controls.

### 0.1.251 - 2026-09-11

- Replace the crowded phone header counts with a colored connection state and
  poll time, and move active and total incident counts to the map’s browse button.
- Remove the floating incident-list scroll arrows and sequence detail-to-list
  transitions so sheets do not overlap or flash at full-screen height.

### 0.1.250 - 2026-09-11

- Keep incident details at the compact half-height by default, allow an upward
  swipe to settle at full height, and return to compact height on the first
  downward swipe.

### 0.1.249 - 2026-09-10

- Rework the map workspace for phones and desktop with a compact mobile incident
  list, swipeable incident detail sheet, larger marker tap targets, labeled layer
  controls, and responsive layouts that preserve map visibility.
- Add live incident-list search across roads, places, types, status, sources,
  incident numbers, and report details on phones and desktop.
- Preserve mobile incident search and scroll position while moving from results
  to the map card and back, with animated list and detail-sheet transitions.
- Let phone users drag the incident list between closed, browsing, and expanded
  positions, and smoothly reveal the selected marker before showing its card.
- Make the incident detail sheet track the user's finger continuously and ease
  into its compact, expanded, or closed position when released.
- Pin the mobile map workspace to the visible browser edges so dynamic viewport
  changes cannot leave a sticky-looking blank area below the map controls.
- Replace the full-width mobile incident footer with a compact floating browse
  control and anchor incident cards directly to the bottom of the map.
- Put incident updates and camera imagery ahead of administrative metadata,
  enrich compact map cards with time, area, direction, and elevation context,
  and reduce detail-view spacing.
- Open full incident information or camera imagery immediately when a user
  selects a marker or list result; dragging down still provides a compact card.
- Limit automatically opened details to roughly half the phone viewport so the
  selected map location remains visible while details scroll independently.
- Simplify the base-map incident browser into one compact list control with the
  current incident count instead of a split status-and-action pill.
- Pan selected mobile markers after the detail-sheet transition and leave extra
  clearance above the sheet so the incident remains visible on iPhone screens.
- Remove the redundant compact-detail step: close, Escape, and downward drag now
  dismiss details, while Results returns directly to the incident list.
- Keep linked-incident list positioning inside the list scroller so selecting or
  loading an incident cannot shift the entire mobile workspace and expose blank canvas.
- Make the return-to-list action a larger bordered “← Incidents” button consistent
  with the other detail actions.
- Reduce the short-landscape detail sheet to 50% so iPhone landscape retains a
  useful map viewport above the scrollable record.
- Place dense road and elevation temperature readings around their true locations
  with stable collision avoidance and subtle anchor dots when a
  label must move, while retaining the full set of useful readings.
- Use the established Crestmap mountain-and-incident mark in the compact phone
  header and include the latest poll time in its status line.
- Give incident lists and incident details matching close controls, remove the
  redundant reset-view button, and prevent white flashes during sheet transitions.

  charts, and clarify that request country codes include automated traffic.
- Add a four-hour elevation-aware modeled forecast to temperature popups.

### 0.1.237 - 2026-09-06

- Rename the GitHub repository, container image, service identity, Kubernetes resources,
  Prometheus series, Grafana dashboard, and project references from the legacy
  `chp-live-map` name to `crestmap`.
- Expand the Grafana operations dashboard with temperature and road-weather
  refresh age, failure, provider, cache, duration, and result-count panels.

### 0.1.236 - 2026-09-06

- Show an up control after scrolling beyond the first two incidents and return
  the incident list smoothly to its first item when tapped.

### 0.1.235 - 2026-09-06

  or retry status below the map control row so the two states remain readable.

### 0.1.234 - 2026-09-06

- Move NWS advisories into the map control row and reveal the advisory headline,
  affected area, and expiry when tapped.

### 0.1.233 - 2026-09-06

  station availability, alerts, and rain, snow, and ice result counts.

### 0.1.231 - 2026-09-06

- Raise weather, temperature, and aircraft popup cards above their originating
  map markers so the selected icon remains visible.

### 0.1.230 - 2026-09-06

- Remove completed hourly rain, snow, and ice periods from the map and label a
  forecast window as Now only while that interval is actually underway.

### 0.1.229 - 2026-09-06

- Automatically hand off between Forest and Malibu after a manual map pan
  clearly enters the other region, preserving the map center and zoom.

### 0.1.228 - 2026-09-06

- Extend the bundled offline Malibu basemap along Yerba Buena Road, Little
  Sycamore Canyon Road, and western Mulholland Highway.

### 0.1.227 - 2026-09-06

- Add road-aligned temperature and six-hour hazard forecast samples for Yerba
  Buena Road, Little Sycamore Canyon Road, and western Mulholland Highway.

### 0.1.226 - 2026-09-06

- Close the expanded map layer menu when the user taps elsewhere on the page,
  and support closing it with Escape for keyboard users.

### 0.1.225 - 2026-09-06

- Keep the map layer menu within the mobile map viewport and make its controls
  scrollable when the menu is taller than the available map space.

### 0.1.224 - 2026-09-06

- Remove the redundant Map, Summary, History, and About tab row in favor of the
  navigation menu, and condense map status metadata into shorter lines.
- Remove the scraper timestamp and source from the map header because connection
  health and the view-updated time already communicate the useful status there.
- Preserve the incident-data freshness time in the Online status so users can
  see when the server last confirmed the current snapshot.
- Add an Incidents switch to the map layer menu that hides or restores map pins
  without removing incidents from the list or detail views.
- When incident pins are hidden, reveal only the incident explicitly selected
  from the list so its location remains clear without restoring every pin.

### 0.1.223 - 2026-09-06

- Move map-only overlays into a compact menu on the map, and add a subtle
  elevation-aware six-hour rain, snow, and possible-ice forecast layer using
  Open-Meteo road forecasts and relevant National Weather Service alerts.
- Label ALERTCalifornia views as Fire cameras and use explicit RAIN, SNOW, and
  ICE road labels so forecasts cannot be mistaken for temperature sample dots.
- Keep road-weather labels above mile markers, render forecast details in an
  opaque map card, and show the expected start and end times for each condition.
- Remove redundant floating weather tooltips and present non-contiguous model
  hours as separate approximate periods, using “Now” for the current hour.
- Keep an opened road-weather popup visible while Leaflet pans the map to fit it,
  then resume viewport-based marker placement after the popup closes.

### 0.1.222 - 2026-09-06

- Center the temporary temperature-loading status along the top of the map,
  clear of the incident-details control.

### 0.1.221 - 2026-09-06

- Move the temporary temperature-loading pill above the mobile incident-details
  control so the two statuses do not overlap.

### 0.1.220 - 2026-09-06

- Show a compact map status while the initial temperature request loads, with a
  tap-to-retry error state, while leaving cached readings unobstructed on refresh.

### 0.1.219 - 2026-09-04

- Make station-reading age much clearer: begin fading and greying after 30
  minutes, reach full grey by two hours, and retain the reading through three.

### 0.1.218 - 2026-09-04

- Keep aging weather-station labels fully opaque while continuously shifting
  them from green to grey as their observations approach the cutoff.

### 0.1.217 - 2026-09-04

- Gradually grey and fade measured station temperatures after one hour so their
  visual prominence communicates observation age through the three-hour cutoff.

### 0.1.216 - 2026-09-04

- Keep quality-controlled weather-station readings visible for up to three hours
  between remote-station reports, and retain station labels near incidents.

### 0.1.215 - 2026-09-04

- Add San Bernardino CHP dispatch coverage and recognize the mountain segment of
  Route 2, including `SR2` and Big Pines Highway incident labels.

### 0.1.214 - 2026-09-04

- Make measured weather-station temperatures easier to distinguish with compact,
  opaque green badges and stronger station dots while estimates remain plain text.

### 0.1.213 - 2026-09-04

- Augment modeled air temperatures with fresh, quality-controlled NWS/MADIS
  observations from three Forest and three Malibu stations. Distinguish measured
  readings in map labels and details, and omit missing observations or station
  reports older than 90 minutes.

### 0.1.212 - 2026-09-04

- Keep road-temperature labels visible near incident clusters by using tighter
  road-specific clearance, positioning text away from nearby incident markers,
  and sampling surveyed Forest roads every 2.5 miles.

### 0.1.211 - 2026-09-04

- Keep the regional overview focused on road and named-location air temperatures;
  reveal surrounding terrain samples only after zooming in.

### 0.1.210 - 2026-09-04

- Add elevation-aware air-temperature baselines along Forest and Malibu roads,
  using surveyed Forest mile markers and the map's principal Malibu corridors.
  Prefer road samples over the surrounding terrain grid when labels need thinning.

### 0.1.209 - 2026-09-04

- Retain additional eastern Forest air-temperature samples along Highway 39,
  Glendora Mountain and Ridge Roads, and upper Mount Baldy Road.

### 0.1.208 - 2026-09-04

- Keep priority air-temperature samples at Newcomb's Ranch and between the Rock
  Store and Old Place when normal label spacing thins the surrounding terrain grid.

### 0.1.207 - 2026-09-04

- Distribute air-temperature samples across each region on a staggered terrain
  grid, eliminating broad gaps and avoiding the impression of road temperatures.

### 0.1.206 - 2026-09-04

- Move Open-Meteo attribution from the map footer to the About page while keeping
  source details available in each air-temperature popup.

### 0.1.205 - 2026-09-04

- Add optional, subtle elevation-adjusted temperature estimates to Forest and
  Malibu maps, with model timestamps, source attribution, and incident-first label
  placement. Offset labels beside location dots, identify the layer as Air
  temperature, and show details in opaque popups. Cache Open-Meteo requests
  server-side; support an optional paid API key in DigitalOcean web configuration.
  No database migration is required.
- Exclude local environment files, virtual environments, and workstation
  instructions from Docker build contexts.

- Keep only the primary Analytics destination on the installed Google tag; move
  the duplicate secondary property and empty Analytics account to Trash.

### 0.1.204 - 2026-09-04

- Pass Analytics dimensions and internal/developer flags directly to the tag
  configuration so initial pageviews receive the same context as interactions.

### 0.1.203 - 2026-09-04

- Measure deliberate incident/camera selections, region changes, copied links and
  successful new alert subscriptions with restricted event parameters.
- Stabilize Analytics page titles and omit query strings from reported page URLs;
  disable history-based pageviews, automatic search and form measurement in both
  production streams to keep interactions distinct from document loads.
- Add persistent browser modes for internal/developer traffic and automatically
  label admin views. Keep exclusion filters in Testing in both GA4 properties.
- Label the two Analytics properties Primary and Secondary and register usage
  dimensions in the primary property; document configuration and rollback.

### 0.1.202 - 2026-09-04

- Include the configured Google Analytics tag on Summary, History, and About
  pages as well as the map, restoring consistent pageview coverage.
- Use the Google-provided installation tag in production to restore loading
  and route events to the connected Crestmap Analytics destination.

### 0.1.201 - 2026-09-03

- Fix comment form fields overlapping or extending past the panel edge, and
  keep name and contact inputs aligned when their labels wrap.

### 0.1.200 - 2026-09-02

- Refresh ALERTCalifornia camera metadata while the map is active and when a
  backgrounded tab becomes visible again, preventing live cameras from being
  marked stale based on an old page-load snapshot.
- Open current camera images in a responsive in-app full-screen viewer that
  stays synchronized with automatic image refreshes, with the direct image link
  retained as a fallback.

### 0.1.199 - 2026-09-02

- Added an optional ALERTCalifornia camera layer to the live map. Camera markers
  show their current viewing direction, selection reveals a bounded field-of-view
  fan, and the existing detail panel displays the uncropped current image with
  source attribution and a link to the ALERTCalifornia viewer.
- Added the camera layer toggle to the map menu, separated collocated cameras,
  aligned field-of-view fans with their visible marker dots, and credited
  ALERTCalifornia and UC San Diego on the About page.

### 0.1.198 - 2026-09-02

- Fixed the service worker's Content Security Policy so it can cache the pinned
  unpkg Leaflet assets and successfully activate for cold offline launches.
- Clean up incomplete application-shell caches when installation fails and test
  that the worker policy permits its required external downloads.

### 0.1.197 - 2026-09-01

- Added versioned application-shell caching so the installed app can launch
  after being force-closed while the device is offline.
- Cached the existing pinned unpkg Leaflet JavaScript and CSS without moving
  those files onto Crestmap hosting.
- Registered offline support independently of push-notification availability
  and added a simulated unreachable-origin cold-navigation test.

### 0.1.196 - 2026-09-01

- Added durable last-known incident snapshots for each map region and history
  window, with automatic refresh and recovery when connectivity returns.
- Added explicit online, reconnecting, and offline status with the saved-data
  timestamp instead of relying only on a generic stale-data warning.
- Added a lightweight bundled road-and-boundary basemap for Forest and Malibu so
  incidents, mile markers, and user location remain geographically useful when
  OpenStreetMap raster tiles are unavailable.
- Added offline snapshot, connection-state recovery, and bundled-basemap tests.

### 0.1.195 - 2026-08-31

- Fixed navigation menus being clipped on iPhone; menus now stay within the
  visible viewport and scroll independently when space is limited.

### 0.1.194 - 2026-08-30

- Added a Corners link to the navigation menu for the corner crash-count map.

### 0.1.193 - 2026-08-30

- Added this repository changelog and backfilled its release history.
- Required future agents/contributors to maintain Unreleased entries and move them
  into dated version sections when preparing releases.
- Added configurable rolling admin sessions, an optional 30-day remembered-device
  login, and a sessions page for per-device and all-device revocation.
- Prevented background map polling from renewing admin sessions; only active
  interaction renews normal sessions, with a fixed maximum lifetime.
- Wired session lifetime settings into DigitalOcean Compose and Kubernetes.
- Fixed login-card overflow on narrow phone screens.
- Added persisted, hashed session records. Existing browser logins require one
  fresh sign-in after this database migration; logout now revokes server-side
  access as well as clearing the cookie.

### 0.1.192 - 2026-08-30

- Made location following opt-in on every page load. When geolocation permission
  is already granted, the blue dot updates quietly without moving the map; the
  location button enables centering and follow mode
  ([ce716fa](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/ce716fa5c2291beeab9a9aa8d481229fc4a04864)).

### 0.1.191 - 2026-08-29

- Expanded official mile-marker coverage for GMR, GRR, Highway 39/San Gabriel
  Canyon, and Mount Baldy Road, and displayed every trusted marker at zoom 16+.
- Auto-published new incident comments and approved media by default, with an
  environment switch available to restore pre-publication moderation
  ([426259c](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/426259c6016d8bf5dc8b064a8a58f99542e5549c)).

### 0.1.190 - 2026-08-29

  accuracy circle, follow mode, and map-interaction pause behavior
  ([ffd8bb0](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/ffd8bb0)).

### 0.1.189 - 2026-08-28

- Expanded official marker coverage across Angeles Crest, Angeles Forest, Big
  Tujunga, and Upper Big Tujunga
  ([e7419ef](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/e7419ef)).

### 0.1.187 - 2026-08-25

- Excluded US-101 freeway incidents from Malibu results
  ([f81a209](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/f81a209)).

### 0.1.175-0.1.186 - 2026-08-11 to 2026-08-17

- Added WildWeb/CAANCC as a second incident source with independent collection,
  storage, map display, and conservative source-aware statuses
  ([0cbee0b](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/0cbee0b)).
- Improved descriptions and sorting while keeping WildWeb reports out of CHP
  active counts ([cc5c9af](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/cc5c9af),
  [83dd658](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/83dd658)).
- Distinguished archived and aging WildWeb reports
  ([f4decc2](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/f4decc2),
  [8e84a00](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/8e84a00),
  [4086145](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/4086145)).
- Preserved cleared details and kept the mobile detail cue near the map bottom
  ([1f5cb05](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/1f5cb05),
  [cf28a79](https://github.com/cajaks2/crestmap/commit/cf28a79)).
